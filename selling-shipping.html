<h3>
How does shipping work?
</h3>
<p>
On Curtsy, buyers pay for shipping. We add $5 to the price you set to cover shipping costs, that way they aren’t surprised by any shipping fees at checkout. When you make a sale, we email you a prepaid shipping label that you can use. All you have to do is print it out, package up your item and give it to USPS.
</p>

<h3>
I don’t have any boxes or envelopes. What should I do?
</h3>
<p>
We offer 10-item and 25-item Shipping Kits that make it easy to ship -- they come with large envelopes, shipping label holders, and Curtsy swag. You don’t need any tape, and the envelopes are self-sealing. Purchase one here. 
</p>
<p>
All post office locations have free envelopes and boxes that you can use with our labels. The next time you’re at the post office, take a handful with you for next time. Having supplies on hand will help you avoid a trip to the post office. 
</p>
<h3>
What if I don’t have a printer?
</h3>
<p>
We’re happy to mail you a shipping label free of charge, just let us know. 
</p>
<h3>
What’s the easiest way to ship?
</h3>
<p>
The easiest way to ship is to schedule a post office pickup, so that your item is picked up from your house by your regular mail carrier. This service is totally free!
</p>
<p>
The second easiest way to ship is dropping your item off at any blue USPS drop box. These are located everywhere, use this tool to find the nearest one to you.  Be careful as  only small boxes and envelopes will fit in these. 
</p>
<h3>
Can I use my own box?
</h3>
<p>
Yeah! As long as your item is under 2lbs, you can use any box or envelope. We recommend using a box or envelope that is close in size to the item you’re shipping. If your item is more than 2lbs, let us know.
</p>
<h3>
How long do I have to ship?
</h3>
<p>
We ask that all sellers ship orders within 2 days.
</p>
<h3>
When do I get paid for my order?
</h3>
<p>
You’ll be paid when the tracking shows your item has shipped. The money will be added to your Curtsy Wallet in the app. From there, you can transfer instantly to your debit card (less than 5 minutes)  or bank account (2-3 days).  
</p>
<h3>
I need more time to ship. What should I do?
</h3>
<p>
We get it -- life can get busy! Make sure to let the buyer know when you plan on shipping it, and give her the option to cancel if that doesn’t work for them.
</p>
<h3>
After I ship, how long does it take to get to the buyer?
</h3>
<p>
We use the Priority Mail service, which takes between 1-3 days depending on location. The average transit time is 2 days, so an item shipped on Monday would be delivered on Wednesday, for example.
</p>
<h3>
Can I ship it from UPS or Fedex?
</h3>
<p>
No -- our labels only work with USPS. We may add additional carriers in the future. Some UPS stores will ship USPS packages for you (using our label), but not all-- so we’d recommend calling ahead.
