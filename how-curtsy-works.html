                <h1>Why you'll love Curtsy</h1>
<h5>Shop. Slay. Sell. Repeat.</h5>
<p>
Curtsy is an app that lets you buy and sell cute clothes. It’s a fun way to always have something new to wear. Sell your stuff, fund a new outfit, wear it then repeat.
</p>
<p>
We’re big on the <strong>resale</strong> -- when you buy items on Curtsy, they go into your closet so you can easily resell them in the future with one tap.  
</p>
<p>
It’s 2018, honey. There’s no reason to hold onto clothes. You know you’re only going to wear it once anyways :) 
<br>
<br>
</p>
<h2>
How selling works
</h2>
<p>
Curtsy is the easiest way to sell your cute clothes. We recommend selling the stuff that you’d still want to buy. Items that are on trend and in-season sell best.
</p>
<h5>
POST IN UNDER A MINUTE
</h5>
<p>
Posting is quick and easy: we’ll ask you to upload photos, describe your item, and set your price.  Not sure about price? Don’t worry! We’ll suggest a price based on the recently sold items with the same brand and condition.
</p>
<p>
To ensure a good shopping experience for buyers on Curtsy, we require all listings have at least one photo of the item on a person. 
</p>
<h5>
SIMPLE SHIPPING
</h5>
<p>
On Curtsy, buyers pay for shipping. We don’t surprise buyers with shipping fees during checkout, we include it in the price they see on your listing. It doesn’t come out of your earnings. 
</p>
<p>
After getting a sale, we’ll text and email you a link to print out your pre-paid shipping label. Our label is for USPS Priority Mail (1-3 days). You can use any box or envelope, or free supplies at USPS. 
</p>
<p>
You can give the package to your mailwoman, drop it any blue collection box, schedule a free package pickup, or take it to the post office. 
</p>
<p>
While you’re at the post office, feel free to grab some free shipping supplies for your next order. 
</p>
<h5>
INSTANT PAYOUTS
</h5>
<p>
You’ll be paid when the tracking shows the item is shipped. The money will go into your Curtsy Wallet, and from there you can transfer instantly to your debit card or bank (takes less than 5 minutes) OR spend the money in the app :) 
</p>
<h5>
OUR FEE
</h5>
<p>
We keep a small portion of every sale that we use to run our platform. You’ll be able to see the exact amount we take when you post so there are no surprises.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<h2>
How Buying Works
</h2>
<p>
Curtsy is the #1 place to save on cute clothes. It's like Nordstrom or Revolve, but way cheaper.  We recommend checking the app daily for new arrivals and “loving” items you like-- the good ones won’t be around for long!
</p>
<h5>
PRIORITY SHIPPING INCLUDED 
</h5>
<p>
There are no hidden shipping fees -- the prices you see in the app already include 1-3 day Priority shipping through USPS.  Most items take 2 days in transit after the item is shipped by the seller.  
</p>
<p>
Need it soon? Feel free to message the seller before you buy and ask when they could ship it.
</p>
<p>
After your item is shipped you’ll get a text with a link to track it. 
</p>
<h5>
APPLE PAY &amp; MORE
</h5>
<p>
When you’re ready to buy, easily checkout using Apple Pay or any major credit or debit card. Payment is securely handled by Curtsy and we hold the money until the seller has actually shipped your item.
</p>
<h5>
ASK QUESTIONS
</h5>
<p>
There’s a button on every item to contact the sellers. Most sellers reply in under an hour.  Need help from Curtsy? We’ll message you when you sign up -- just reply to that message if you ever need help.  
</p>
<h5>
WORRIED ABOUT FIT?
</h5>
<p>
While we don’t offer returns, we do move the item into your Curtsy closet after you buy so you can easily resell it with one tap. 
</p>
<p>
Chances are if you bought something, someone else wants it to-- most items that are re-listed sell in under 48 hours. 
</p>
<h5>
BUYER GUARANTEE
</h5>
<p>
We guarantee a full refund if there are any issues with the item that weren’t described in the listing.  Our support team is available via chat and phone throughout your whole buying experience in case you need help for any reason
