<p><b>Listings</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an Owner, you may list items for rent. &nbsp;You are responsible for taking pictures that accurately portray the item to be rented, and responding promptly to requests and to determine a good time to drop off or have the Renter pick up the item at your agreed location. To this end, you will be asked a variety of questions about the listed items, including: location, size, brand, retail and rental price, availability and description.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are required to ensure that your item is in clean, wearable condition upon renting it out to a Renter. Failure to provide Renters with clothing or other wearables in dry-cleaned or hand-washed condition could result in a claim against your payout.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You understand and agree that Curtsy does not act as an insurer or as a contracting agent for you as an Owner.

Curtsy serves as the limited authorized agent of the Owner for the purpose of accepting payments from Members. You acknowledge and agree that, as an Owner, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions.</span></p>
<h3><b>Renters</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Owners of the items are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed bookings and making available any Item for rent reserved through Curtsy. Curtsy is not responsible for this.

You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Curtsy, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, that Curtsy is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of its payment obligations hereunder, Curtsy disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements. You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the fact that Curtsy is not a party to the agreement between you and the Owner, Curtsy acts as the Owner’s payment agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the Owner. &nbsp;You agree to pay Curtsy for the full Listing Price as well as any additional late fees or damage claims for any booking requested in connection with your Curtsy Account if such fees are claimed by the applicable Owner and later verified by Curtsy. In order to establish a booking pending the applicable Owner’s confirmation of your requested booking, you understand and agree that Curtsy, on behalf of the Owner, reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to obtain a pre-authorization via your credit card for the any such fees. Once Curtsy receives confirmation of your booking from the applicable Owner or confirms any claims related to delayed return or damage, Curtsy will collect the Total Fees in accordance with the terms and conditions of these Terms and the pricing terms set forth in the applicable Listing. Please note that Curtsy cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Member by his or her own bank related to Curtsy’s collection of the Total Fees, and Curtsy disclaims all liability in this respect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In connection with your requested booking, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing item, and credit card information to Curtsys’ third party payment processor Braintree payments. You agree to pay Curtsy for any confirmed bookings made in connection with your Curtsy Account in accordance with these Terms by credit or debit card. You authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the booking, either directly by Curtsy or indirectly, via our third party online payment processor. You also authorize Curtsy to charge your credit card in the event of damage caused to an Item for rent as described previously in these Terms. If you are directed to Curtsy’s third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s personal information collection practices. Please review such Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy before using the services. Once you reserve an item and the Owner accepts, you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed booking.</span></p>

THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN Curtsy AND YOU. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</span></p>
<h3><b>Indemnification</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You agree to release, defend, indemnify, and hold Curtsy and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and their officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with: (1) your access to or use of the Site, Application, Services, or Collective Content or your violation of these Terms; (2) your Member Content; (3) your (i) interaction with any Member, (ii) booking of an Item for rent, (iii) creation of a Listing or (iv) the use, condition or rental of an Item for rent by you, including any injuries, losses, or damages (compensatory, direct, incidental, consequential or otherwise) of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of a rental, booking or use of an Item for rent and (4) your participation in the Referral Program or your accrual of any Curtsy Travel Credits.</span></p>
<h3><b>Assignment</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Curtsy’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. Curtsy may assign or transfer these Terms, at its sole discretion, without restriction.</span></p>
<h3><b>Notices</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any notices or other communications permitted or required hereunder, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be in writing and given by Curtsy (i) via email (in each case to the item that you provide) or (ii) by posting to the Site or via the Application.</span></p>
<h3><b>Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the United States of America, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions. You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located &nbsp;in the state or district of your residence as specified on Curtsy for any actions for which the parties retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights, as set forth in the Dispute Resolution provision below.</span></p>
<h3><b>Dispute Resolution</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curtsy does not own the items; Curtsy merely acts as third-party remediator for our lenders and Renters in the event of a dispute or occasion where a neutral (third) party is needed. Examples include, but are not limited to: disputes regarding pricing of the item, condition/damage of the item, refunds and cancellations, etc.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">You and Curtsy agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, or to the use of the application (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and Curtsy are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Curtsy otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. </span></h3>
<h3><b>General</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The failure of Curtsy to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Curtsy. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</span></p>
