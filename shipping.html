                <h2>FAQs</h2>
                <h3>Can I use my own box or envelope?</h3>
                <p>
                Yeah! As long as your item is under 5 lbs, you can use any box. If your item is more than 5 lbs, let us know.
                </p>
                <h3>What if I don't have any boxes or envelopes?</h3>
                <p>
                We offer our <a href="https://shop.curtsyapp.com/shipping-kit">Shipping Kit</a> which has enough supplies for 10 sales.
                </p>
                <h3>Can I use the free Priority Mail supplies at the post office?</h3>
                <p>
                It depends! Your label will either say <strong>First Class</strong> (items under 1 lb) or <strong>Priority Mail</strong> (1-5 lbs). If you label says <strong>Priority Mail</strong> on it, you can use free supplies at your local post office. The free supplies don't work with the First Class label
                </p>
                <h3>Can I just put it in my mailbox?</h3>
                <p>
                If the item is packed and ready to go, feel free to leave it with your regular mail or hand it to your mailman. 
                </p>
                <h3>Do I have to go the post office?</h3>
                <p>
                No! The USPS will <a href="https://tools.usps.com/go/ScheduleAPickupAction!input.action">pick up</a> your package during your regular mail delivery for free. <a href="https://tools.usps.com/go/ScheduleAPickupAction!input.action">Schedule it online</a> the night before. 
                </p>
                <h3>My label says "First Class" but my item weights more than 1 lb. What should I do?</h3>
                <p>
                Write into support and let us know-- we'll get you a new label.
                </p>
                <h3>When do I get paid for my order?</h3>
                <p>
                You’ll be paid when the tracking updates to show the item is shipped.  After that, you can transfer the money instantly to your debit card or bank account. This usually only takes 30 seconds to 5 minutes.
                </p>
                <h3>How long do I have to ship? </h3>
                <p>
                We ask that all sellers ship orders within 2 days. 
                </p>
                <h3>I need more time to ship. What should I do?</h3>
                <p>
                Make sure to let the buyer know when you plan on shipping it, and keep her updated! If they need it before you can ship it, offer to cancel and refund them.
                </p>
                <h3>After I ship, how long does it take to get to the buyer? </h3>
                <p>
                Your label will be either <strong>First Class</strong> (items under 1 lb) or <strong>Priority Mail</strong> (1-5 lbs). First Class takes 2-4 days and Priority Mail takes 1-3 days, depending on you and the buyer's location.
                </p>
                <p>
                The average transit time is 2 days, so an item shipped on Monday would be delivered on Wednesday, for example. 
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Can I ship it from UPS or Fedex?
                </h3>
                <p>
                Our labels only work with USPS— the U.S. Postal Service. We may add additional carriers in the future. Some UPS stores allow you to drop of USPS packages, but not all of them. We recommend calling ahead to be sure. 
                </p>

                <h2>Tips on becoming a shipping goddess</h2>
                <h3>Ship the order promptly</h3>
                <p>
                    Buyers are happiest when their order ships out within two days. If you need more time, be sure to let the buyer know. Good communication and fast shipping will help you maintain your high seller rating. 
                </p>
                <h3>Use our Shipping Kit</h3>
                <p>
                Our <a href="https://shop.curtsyapp.com/shipping-kit">Shipping Kit</a> makes it easy to ship and comes with enough shipping supplies for 10 orders. You don’t need any tape, and the envelopes are self-sealing. <a href="https://shop.curtsyapp.com/shipping-kit">Buy one here for $3.84.</a>
                </p>
                <h3>Don't mix up shipping companies :)</h3>
                <p>
                Our labels only work with the U.S. Postal Service — not UPS or Fedex. <br>
                </p>

                <h3>Save your Amazon boxes</h3>
                <p>
                    You can use your own boxes with our labels as long as your item is under 5 lbs. To ensure no issues during shipping, choose a box that's close in size to the item you're shipping.
                </p>
                <a id="free-supplies"></a>
                <h3>If your label says "Priority Mail" you can use free supplies at the post office</h3>
                <p>
                The USPS offers free boxes and envelopes for labels that say "Priority Mail" on them (the label for items over 1 lb). These won't work with our "First Class" label. For those, we recommend our <a href="https://shop.curtsyapp.com/shipping-kit">Shipping Kit</a>.
