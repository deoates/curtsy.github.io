<h3>How does selling work?</h3>
<p>
Selling on Curtsy is easy! Posting takes just a minute-- just add pictures, describe the item, and set your price. We’ll even suggest a price to make it easy.
</p>
<p>
When your items sell, we’ll send you a prepaid shipping label that you can use. After the tracking updates to show the item has shipped, we’ll add your earnings to your Curtsy Wallet in the app. From there, you can transfer instantly to your debit card (less than 5 minutes) or your bank (2-3 days). 
</p>

<h3>What can I sell? </h3>
<p>
Right now we support most types of womens clothing that are in new, like-new, or excellent condition with no stains or damage. We don’t currently support bags, shoes, jewelry or other accessories, but we plan on adding those soon. 
</p>
<h3>How can I be successful on Curtsy?</h3>
<p>
We recommend selling what you’d still want to buy! Items that were purchased in the last few years from recognizable brands or boutiques sell best. Photos are extremely important-- we require all listings have at least one photo of the item on a person. The price is also really important -- the better the deal, the faster your items will sell. 
</p>
<p>
After you post your item you’ll have the option to share it on your Instagram Story. Sellers that share are 50% more likely to make a sale in their first day. 
</p>
<h3>
I want to clean out my closet fast. Any tips?
</h3>
<p>
The lower your prices, the faster your items will sell. That and great pictures are the easiest ways to make a quick sale. 
</p>
<h3>
How does shipping work?
</h3>
<p>
On Curtsy, buyers pay for shipping. We add $5 to the price you set to the price buyers see on your item. That way, they aren’t surprised by any shipping fees at checkout. This doesn’t impact your earnings. 
</p>
<p>
After you make a sale we’ll text you a link to print your prepaid shipping label.  No printer? No worries. We’re happy to send you a label in the mail.

<h3>
What’s the easiest way to ship? 
</h3>
<p>
We offer 10-item and 25-item Shipping Kits that make shipping easy. They come with self-sealing envelopes, adhesive shipping label holders, and Curtsy swag of course ;) 
</p>
<p>
After packaging up your item the easiest way to ship it is to schedule a pickup during your regular mail delivery or dropping the item in a blue USPS drop box, located everywhere.
</p>

<h3>
How do I get paid?
</h3>
<p>
Once the tracking updates to show the item was shipped, the money will go into your Curtsy Wallet in the app. From there you have two options to get your money:
<ul>
<li>Payout to debit card (takes less than 5 minutes)
<li>Payout to a bank account (takes 2-3 days). 
</ul>
</p>
<h3>
What if I've shipped my item but haven't been paid yet?
</h3>
<p>
Sometimes it takes the post office a few hours, even up to 24 hours, to scan in your package for the first time. Your earnings will be added to your Curtsy Wallet after the package is scanned in for the first time.
</p>
<h3>
Can buyers make offers on my items?
</h3>
<p>
Yep! 72 hours after your item has been posted we’ll allow potential buyers to make offers. We do this to give your item some time to sell at full price before you have to entertain offers. Offers are binding (the buyer is paid if you accept) and you have 24 hours to respond.
