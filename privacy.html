                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
 <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curtsy, Inc: Privacy Policy</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This document outlines Curtsy, Inc’s (“Curtsy”) privacy policy; reserves Curtsy the right to collect, store, and share application and user data as specified; and relieves Curtsy of any and all legal liability in certain scenarios. If you choose to use Curtsy and accept the Terms and Conditions, you are voluntarily participating in an application governed by this document, and in agreement with the terms and conditions specified herein. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We collect the following types of information.</span></p>
<p><b>Information you provide us directly:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your username, password, and e-mail address when you register for a Curtsy account.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Profile information that you provide for your user profile, including but not limited to your first and last name, picture, location, and phone number. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">User content, including but not limited to photos, comments, and other materials that you post on the application.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communications between you and Curtsy. For example, you may be sent Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication between you and Curtsy users. For example, messages sent between you and another user.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Analytics information:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third-party analytics tools are used to measure traffic and usage trends in Curtsy. These tools collect information sent by your device, including but not limited to the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists in the improvement of &nbsp;user experience and application functionality. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cookies and similar technologies:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cookies and similar technologies, such as pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information about how you use Curtsy and provide features to you.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advertisers or other partners may be called upon to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use cookies or similar technologies to achieve this goal</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Log file information:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curtsy’s servers automatically record certain log file information, including but not limited to your web requests, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring/exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, and how you interact with links, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. Similar information may be collected from emails sent to users which then help to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the user experience and application functionality.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Device identifiers:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you use a mobile device, such as a tablet or phone to access Curtsy, Curtsy reserves the right access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Curtsy.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use Curtsy and may help to provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Curtsy may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Metadata:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with user content. For example, metadata can describe how, when, and by whom a piece of user content was collected and how that content is formatted.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users can add or may have metadata added to their user content, including but not limited to product colors, size, fit, geotag (i.e., location marker of the product), comments, or other data. This makes your user content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using other’s APIs then, your geolocation will be stored with the photo and the dress then searchable.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</span></h3>

<p><b>Parties with whom we reserve the right to &nbsp;share your information:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Your information and user content (including but not limited to information from cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) may be shared with businesses that are legally part of the same group of companies that Curtsy is part of, or that become part of that group (“Affiliates”). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service (including by providing analytics) and Affiliates’ own services (including by providing you with better and more relevant experiences). These Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can see your photos.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also reserve the right to &nbsp;share your information, as well as information gathered through the use of tools such as cookies, log files, and device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations (“Service Providers”) that help us provide the Service to you . Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also reserve the right to share certain information, such as cookie data, with third-party advertising partners. This information may allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We reserve the right to &nbsp;remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties.

</ul>
<p><b>Parties with whom you may choose to share your user content:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as user content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you set. To change your privacy settings on the Service, please change your profile setting. Once you have shared user content or made it public, that user content may be re-shared by others.</span></li>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Curtsy or our assets to another organization, your information, such as name, email address, user content, and any other information previously collected, may be among the items sold or transferred.

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We reserve the right to access, preserve, and share your information in response to a legal request (such as a search warrant, court order, or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the Law otherwise requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. Curtsy also reserves the right to access, preserve, and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent, and/or address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you, and others, including as part of investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.
