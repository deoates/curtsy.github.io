<h3>
How does shipping work?
</h3>
<p>
On Curtsy, buyers pay for shipping. The price of shipping is either $4.25 (if your item is under 1 lb), or $7.50 (more than 1 lb). You'll select the correct price when you post your item.
</p>
<p>
When you make a sale, we email you a prepaid shipping label that you can use. All you have to do is print it out, package up your item and give it to USPS.
</p>
<h3>
I don’t have any boxes or envelopes. What should I do?
</h3>
<p>
Our <a href="https://shop.curtsyapp.com/shipping-kit">Shipping Kit</a> comes with enough shipping supplies for 10 orders. You don’t need any tape, and the envelopes are self-sealing. <a href="https://shop.curtsyapp.com/shipping-kit">Buy one here for $3.84.</a>
</p>
<p>
Your label will say either <strong>First Class</strong> (items under 1 lb) or <strong>Priority Mail</strong> (1-5 lbs). If your label says <strong>Priority Mail</strong> you can use free supplies at your local post office. These won't work with <strong>First Class</strong>. For both types of labels, we recommend our <a href="https://shop.curtsyapp.com/shipping-kit">Shipping Kits</a>.
</p>
<h3>
What is a Shipping Kit?
</h3>
<p>
Our Shipping Kit makes selling really easy. Each kit comes with enough shipping supplies for 10 orders. You don’t need any tape, and the envelopes are self-sealing. Best part is-- you'll save a trip to the post office when you have supplies on hand. <a href="https://shop.curtsyapp.com/buy/imB1yQBUSE">Buy one here for $3.84</a> (that's only 38 cents per order).
</p>
                <h3>Can I use the free Priority Mail supplies at the post office?</h3>
                <p>
                It depends! Your label will either say <strong>First Class</strong> (items under 1 lb) or <strong>Priority Mail</strong> (1-5 lbs). If you label says <strong>Priority Mail</strong> on it, you can use free supplies at your local post office. The free supplies don't work with the First Class label.
                </p>
<h3>
What if I don’t have a printer?
</h3>
<p>
We’re happy to mail you a shipping label free of charge, just let us know. 
</p>
<h3>
What’s the easiest way to ship?
</h3>
<p>
The easiest way to ship is to <a href="https://tools.usps.com/go/ScheduleAPickupAction!input.action">schedule a USPS pickup</a>, so that your item is picked up from your house by your regular mail carrier. This service is totally free! With our <a href="https://shop.curtsyapp.com/shipping-kit">Shipping Kit</a>, you'll have supplies on hand when you get an order. 
</p>
<p>
The second easiest way to ship is dropping your item off at any blue USPS drop box. <a href="https://tools.usps.com/go/POLocatorAction.action" target="blank">Find one near you.</a>  Be careful: only small boxes and envelopes will fit in these. 
</p>
<p>
And of course, you can always ship from your <a href="https://tools.usps.com/go/POLocatorAction!input.action">nearest post office</a> :) 
</p>
<h3>
Can I use my own box?
</h3>
<p>
Yeah! As long as your item is under 5lbs, you can use any box or envelope. We recommend using a box or envelope that is close in size to the item you’re shipping. If your item is more than 5lbs, let us know.
</p>
<h3>
How long do I have to ship?
</h3>
<p>
We ask that all sellers ship orders within 2 days.
</p>
<h3>
When do I get paid for my order?
</h3>
<p>
You’ll be paid when the tracking shows your item has shipped. The money will be added to your Curtsy Wallet in the app. From there, you can transfer instantly to your debit card (less than 5 minutes)  or bank account (2-3 days).  
</p>
<h3>
I need more time to ship. What should I do?
</h3>
    <p>
    No worries! Just let the buyer know when you can ship it, and keep them updated. If they need it before you can ship it, offer to cancel and refund them.
    </p>
<h3>
After I ship, how long does it take to get to the buyer?
</h3>
                <p>
                Your label will be either <strong>First Class</strong> (items under 1 lb) or <strong>Priority Mail</strong> (1-5 lbs). First Class takes 2-4 days and Priority Mail takes 1-3 days, depending on you and the buyer's location.
                </p>
                <p>
                The average transit time is 2 days, so an item shipped on Monday would be delivered on Wednesday, for example. 
                </p>
<h3>
Can I ship it from UPS or Fedex?
</h3>
<p>
Our labels only work with USPS— the U.S. Postal Service. We may add additional carriers in the future. Some UPS stores allow you to drop of USPS packages, but not all of them. We recommend calling ahead to be sure. 
</p>
<h3>
How can I buy a Shipping Kit?
</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://shop.curtsyapp.com/buy/imB1yQBUSE">You can purchase a Shipping Kit here</a>. We ship these out every day so you'll get it just a few days after ordering.
